# Session Notes: 2025-10-17 - Phase 2 Complete

## Summary
Successfully implemented **Phase 2: Parallel Flow Detection** with straightforward, production-ready code. The system now detects independent parallel data flows in NiFi workflows and generates flow context for LLM integration.

## What Was Completed

### 1. Core Parallel Flow Detection Module
**File**: `tools/parallel_flow_detector.py`

Created simple, focused detection algorithm:
- `build_processor_graph()`: Builds NetworkX DAG from NiFi processors and connections
- `find_parallel_subgraphs()`: Identifies independent parallel flows (no shared processors)
- `calculate_flow_similarity()`: Computes structural similarity based on processor types
- `cluster_similar_flows()`: Groups flows with >90% similarity threshold
- `extract_flow_parameters()`: Extracts differentiating parameters (site, table, path)
- `detect_parallel_flows()`: Main function returning flow groups and processor mapping

**Design Principle**: Straightforward logic without over-engineering - no complex exception handling or unnecessary abstractions.

### 2. Processor Payload Integration
**File**: `tools/classification/processor_payloads.py`

Enhanced processor payloads:
- Added `flow_context` field to `ProcessorPayload` dataclass
- Updated `build_payloads()` to accept `parallel_flows` parameter
- Maps processors to their flow using `processor_to_flow` lookup
- Includes flow_id, is_parallel flag, and parameters in context

### 3. LLM Prompt Enhancements
**File**: `streamlit_app/pages/06_AI_Assist.py`

**TRIAGE_SYSTEM_PROMPT** additions:
- Parallel flow context rules for Layer 1 LLM
- Instructions to generate PARAMETERIZED code using flow_context.parameters
- Document flow parallelization in implementation_hint
- Example: "Part of parallel flow for site=ATKL, table=emt_log"

**COMPOSE_SYSTEM_PROMPT** additions:
- Detect parallel patterns from implementation_hint
- Generate multi-task notebooks with ThreadPoolExecutor or Databricks Jobs pattern
- Create parameterized functions for parallel execution
- Document parallel execution strategy in Migration Notes

**Session State Collection**:
- Added `_collect_parallel_flows()` to gather results from session state
- Integrated with payload building (passes parallel_flows to build_payloads)

### 4. Pipeline Integration
**File**: `tools/workbench/full_analysis.py`

Added Phase 2 step to analysis pipeline:
- Parses NiFi XML to template_data
- Calls `detect_parallel_flows(template_data)`
- Stores results in session state: `parallel_flows_{file_name}`
- Progress tracking: "X parallel flows" message

## Testing Results

**Test File**: `test_parallel_flow_detection.py` (temporary, removed after validation)

**Results with `simple_workflow_demo.xml`**:
- ✅ Processors: 11
- ✅ Connections: 16
- ✅ Total parallel flows: 8
- ✅ Flow groups: 3 clusters
- ✅ Cluster 0: 4 flows (parallel: True)
  - Parameters extracted: site, table, path
- ✅ Cluster 1: 2 flows (parallel: True)
- ✅ Cluster 2: 2 flows (parallel: True)
- ✅ Processor-to-flow mapping: All 11 processors mapped correctly

## Architecture Highlights

### Flow Detection Algorithm
```python
1. Build processor DAG from connections (NetworkX)
2. Find weakly connected components (parallel subgraphs)
3. Calculate structural similarity between flows
4. Cluster flows with >90% processor type match
5. Extract differentiating parameters from processor properties
6. Return flow groups + processor-to-flow mapping
```

### LLM Integration Flow
```
NiFi XML → detect_parallel_flows() → flow_context
         → build_payloads() → processor payload with flow_context
         → TRIAGE LLM → parameterized code snippets
         → COMPOSE LLM → multi-task notebook with ThreadPoolExecutor
```

### Expected Multi-Task Notebook Pattern
```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def process_site_table(site, table):
    # Parameterized data processing
    ...

with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=4) as executor:
    futures = [
        executor.submit(process_site_table, 'ATTJ', 'emt_log'),
        executor.submit(process_site_table, 'ATTJ', 'emt_log_attributes'),
        executor.submit(process_site_table, 'ATKL', 'emt_log'),
        executor.submit(process_site_table, 'ATKL', 'emt_log_attributes'),
    ]
    for future in futures:
        future.result()
```

## Key Commits

### Commit: 8a897c2
**Message**: "Implement Phase 2: Parallel Flow Detection for multi-task notebooks"

**Files Changed**:
- `tools/parallel_flow_detector.py` (new, 150 lines)
- `tools/classification/processor_payloads.py` (+flow_context integration)
- `streamlit_app/pages/06_AI_Assist.py` (+flow context prompts)
- `tools/workbench/full_analysis.py` (+Phase 2 step)
- Session notes and docs cleanup

## Design Decisions

1. **Straightforward Implementation**: User requested "straightforward function without unnecessary or complicate fail out / exception etc." - followed this directive strictly
2. **NetworkX for Graph Operations**: Simple, well-tested library for DAG operations
3. **>90% Similarity Threshold**: Balance between strictness and flexibility for flow clustering
4. **Parameter Extraction**: Pattern matching on processor properties (site, fab, table, path keywords)
5. **LLM Guidance in Prompts**: Not hardcoded logic - prompts guide LLM on how to use flow_context

## What's Next: Phase 3

**Phase 3: Enhanced Table Lineage** (from `docs/migration_improvement_plan_S3.md`)

Goals:
- Enhance table lineage to differentiate READ vs WRITE operations
- Track partition filters (site, year, month, day)
- Identify incremental vs full refresh patterns
- Map business logic patterns (Bronze/Silver/Gold layers)

This will build on Phase 1 (SQL extraction) and Phase 2 (parallel flows) to provide complete data flow understanding for migration.

## Status

- ✅ Phase 1: SQL Extraction Integration (COMPLETE)
  - Commit: 3717604, ea1d097
- ✅ Phase 2: Parallel Flow Detection (COMPLETE)
  - Commit: 8a897c2
- ⏳ Phase 3: Enhanced Table Lineage (PENDING)

**Branch**: `schema_ai_migration`
**Next Session**: Start Phase 3 implementation
